## CAT VS DOG CLASSIFIER 🐱🐶

This is a flask app which predicts whether the given image belongs to cat category or dog category. I have used the concept of transfer learning in this project. I used the pre-trained [VGG-16 model architecture](https://neurohive.io/en/popular-networks/vgg16/) which was trained with ImageNet dataset. I trained this model (by freezing the in-between convolutional layers having previously trained weights) on [Cat-vs-Dog dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition) from Kaggle competition. I am able to achieve around 92% accuracy on the validation dataset.

### Steps to clone this repo on local machine 🥳
This repository contains an LFS file (VGG_model.h5) as this weights file is of 156 mb and github only allows to upload files which are less than 100 mb. So follow the steps below to clone it - 
1. Download and install [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) on your machine.
2. Then after configuring Git LFS, open Bash console and type the usual git clone command. 
    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/sudeeep885/Cat-vs-Dog-Flask-web-app.git
    ```

### Steps to run the cat vs dog classifier app on your machine 🎉
1. Fire up the terminal in the cloned repository directory.

2. First create a virtual environment.
    ```shell
    virtualenv .env
    ```
3. Activate the virtual environment.
    ```shell
    . ./.env/Scripts/activate
    ```
4. Install the packages from requirements.txt file
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5. Then finally start the flask app by typing
    ```shell
    python main.py
    ```
